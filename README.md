## Advice & Troubleshooting

A set of tools helpful for this project, combined with some of the minor annoyances discovered in the project. This is in hope of making someone's life easier next year !

- matplotlib on remote servers. [This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801882/generating-a-png-with-matplotlib-when-display-is-undefined) is a good fix.
- [Interactive classes in iPython](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/extensions/autoreload.html) (update on edit)
- [A good python editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - [free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
- [Setting up python remotely](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/public_server.html)
- use the `--user` option to install pip modules to your home directory. rayxx.doc.ic.ac.uk machines have pip - batch servers **do not** (but you can `workon` a virtualenv that does have pip!)
